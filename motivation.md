## Motivations?

HBR - *One More Time: How Do You Motivate Employee* - **On Managing People**

Let me begin by sort of describing my mental model of motivation. Then, I can
give you an example from my experience. I will conclude by sharing how  I think
this might apply to this current role we are talking about.

The psychology of motivation is complex and at times, counter-intuitive.

In my last 8-9 years of leadership experience, I have seen that motivation does
not necessarily come from perks, promotions, salary and titles. They definitely
set the initial extrinsic bar for table stakes, but getting people to be
passionate and be motivated is intrinsic.

We have three levers to pull for motivating and inspiring our team members:

a. Interesting and challenging work
b. Opportunity to learn and hone their skills
c. Fair opportunity to grow into greater responsibility

Really these three things activate the generators.
